            <p class="answer-one">One technology I think will still be around in the future is Smartphones! I think this because Smartphones can be used do to many different tasks. E.G. checking the weather, listening to music, checking the time! I think that, because of the amount of things you can do with smartphones, they will still be useful for many different tasks in the future!</p>

I think this because in the future I think robots will become very useful to people and will be able to help people with everyday tasks! E.G. cleaning the house.</p>
